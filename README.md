# Starcraft League Index Predictor
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Findings
In creating my models, I was able to correctly estimate the LeagueIndex forty percent of the time.

When I attempted to estimate if the player was in professional, or in LeagueIndex one or two, I was able to estimate this correctly 99 percent of the time.

With there being only eight different options the models were able to narrow the choices to two or three different ranks for the information given and this led to a prediction success rate of around 40 percent.

The best model was the gradient boosted decision trees but the neural network linear regression model only performed slightly worse.
